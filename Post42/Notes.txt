Abstract Method: A method that is declared without an implementation. Abstract methods are typically used in abstract classes or interfaces, requiring subclasses to provide a concrete implementation.
and any class that containes an abstract method must also be declared as abstract. Abstract methods cannot be instantiated directly and are meant to be overridden in derived classes.
