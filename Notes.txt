                                     OOP Concepts in Java

Package : 

    Package in Java is a namespace that organizes a set of related classes and interfaces. Conceptually, you can think of packages as being similar to different folders on your computer. Just as folders help you organize files, packages help you organize your Java classes and interfaces into a structured hierarchy.
Using packages has several benefits:
1. **Namespace Management**: Packages help avoid name conflicts by grouping related classes and interfaces together. For example, you can have two classes with the same name in different packages without any conflict.
2. **Access Control**: Packages provide a way to control access to classes and members. Classes and members can have different access levels (public, protected, default, private) that determine their visibility within the package and to other packages.
3. **Organization**: Packages help in organizing your code logically. This makes it easier to locate and manage classes, especially in large projects.
4. **Reusability**: By grouping related classes into packages, you can easily reuse them in different   projects without having to copy and paste code.
To declare a package in a Java source file, you use the `package` keyword followed by the package name at the very top of the file. For example:
```java
package com.example.myapp;
public class MyClass {
    // class implementation
}
``



#Inheritance : Child class inherits properties and behaviors from a parent class. You incorporate the parent class into the child class using the 'extends' keyword.

# Polymorphism : The ability of different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through a common interface. It allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon, even if they share the same name.

type of Polymorphism : 
 1. Compile time Polymorphism/ Static Polymorphism (Method Overloading) : multiple constructors or methods with the same name but different parameters..
 2. Run time Polymorphism / Dynamic Polymorphism (Method Overriding) :
        The child class overrides the parent class method with a different implementation.
 3. Polymorphism does not apply on instance variables.
 
 Early Binding vs Late Binding :
 Early Binding (Compile time) : The method to be invoked is determined at compile time. This is associated with method overloading.
 Late Binding (Run time) : The method to be invoked is determined at runtime. This is associated with method overriding.
       Example of Inheritance and Polymorphism in Java:
```java
// Parent class
class Animal {
       void sound() {
           System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
       }             
}
// Child class
class Dog extends Animal {
       void sound() { // Method Overriding
                 System.out.println("Dog barks");
       }
}
class Cat extends
       Animal {
              void sound() { // Method Overriding
                     System.out.println("Cat meows");
              }
       }
public class Main {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
              Animal myDog = new Dog(); // Upcasting
              Animal myCat = new Cat(); // Upcasting

              myDog.sound(); // Outputs: Dog barks
              myCat.sound(); // Outputs: Cat meows
       }
}
```
In this example, the `Animal` class is the parent class, and `Dog` and `Cat` are child classes that inherit from `Animal`. The `sound` method is overridden in each child class, demonstrating polymorphism. When we call the `sound` method on an `Animal` reference, the appropriate method for the actual object type (either `Dog` or `Cat`) is invoked at runtime, showcasing dynamic polymorphism.


# Encapsulation : The concept of wrapping data (variables) and methods (functions) together into a single unit known as a class. It restricts direct access to some of the object's components, which can prevent the accidental modification of data. Access to the data is typically provided through public methods (getters and setters).

# Abstraction : The concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of the object. It helps in reducing programming complexity and effort. In Java, abstraction is achieved using abstract classes and interfaces.


// Access Modifiers in java : 
| Modifiers  | Class | Package | Subclass(Same Package) | Subclass(Different Package ) | World (Different Package & not even Subclass)|            
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| public     |  Y    |   Y     |          Y             |            Y                |                Y                    |
| protected  |  Y    |   Y     |          Y             |            Y                |                N                    |
| default    |  Y    |   Y     |          Y             |            N                |                N                    |
| private    |  Y    |   N     |          N             |            N                |                N                    |


# Packages in Java : 
1. In-built Packages : Java provides a rich set of built-in packages like java.lang, java.util, java.io, etc.
2. User-defined Packages : You can create your own packages to organize your classes and interfaces.

Abstract Method: A method that is declared without an implementation. Abstract methods are typically used in abstract classes or interfaces, requiring subclasses to provide a concrete implementation.
and any class that containes an abstract method must also be declared as abstract. Abstract methods cannot be instantiated directly and are meant to be overridden in derived classes.
