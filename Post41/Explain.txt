#Inheritance : Child class inherits properties and behaviors from a parent class. You incorporate the parent class into the child class using the 'extends' keyword.

# Polymorphism : The ability of different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through a common interface. It allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon, even if they share the same name.

type of Polymorphism : 
 1. Compile time Polymorphism/ Static Polymorphism (Method Overloading) : multiple constructors or methods with the same name but different parameters..
 2. Run time Polymorphism / Dynamic Polymorphism (Method Overriding) :
        The child class overrides the parent class method with a different implementation.
